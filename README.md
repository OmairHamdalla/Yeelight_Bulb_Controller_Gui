## Notes 
### IP Range & Auto Connection
-The Auto Connect feature scans your local IP range from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 to find an active Yeelight bulb
-Your device and the bulb must be on the same Wi-Fi network for this to work

###  Customizing Flows and Modes
- Lighting flows are defined using the Flow class in the code as functions, You can customize flow effects by editing the properties of the flow object inside the script.
   - Change duration
   - RGB values
   - transition types
- Preset modes (Study, Rest, Work) are just pre-defined combinations of: 
   - Brightness
   - RGB Color
   - Temperature
